Modular programming in JavaScript is a way of organizing code into smaller, reusable, and maintainable pieces called modules. This approach allows developers to break down complex applications into manageable files. Modules have their own scope, so variables and functions are not globally accessible unless explicitly exported.

There are two primary systems for modules in JavaScript:

    CommonJS: Used primarily in older Node.js environments. Modules are exported using module.exports = {} and imported with require().

    ES6 Modules: The modern standard, which allows for exporting and importing with the export and import keywords. ES6 modules support both named exports (exporting multiple values) and default exports (exporting a single value).

Benefits of Modular Programming:

    Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects.
    Maintainability: Smaller, focused files are easier to manage and update.
    Separation of concerns: Code is organized by functionality, improving clarity.
