my answer ==> Javascript is the blueprint/syntax of the language, it provide us with what is synthetically possible and what is not, OOP, async functions etc, and thats almost it, this is where the compiler comes in, the interpreter like V8 for chrome and node, does everything else from managing memory resource like the stack for functions and premitive variables or the heap for objects and dynamic structures that have to be long lived, handling garbage collection, parsing and interpreting or executing code, also it ptovides access to extra functionality that the language itself doesnt have like web apis (setTimeout, setInterval ...) manages the event loops for handling callbacks and promises though using queues like the callback queue and microtasks queue respectively ¸

Refined Version ==> JavaScript serves as the blueprint/syntax of the language, defining what's syntactically possible, like object-oriented programming (OOP) and async functions. However, the engine (such as V8 for Chrome and Node.js) does the heavy lifting—interpreting the code, performing Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for optimization, and managing resources like memory. It handles the stack for function calls and primitives, and the heap for long-lived objects. Additionally, the engine manages garbage collection, parses and executes code, and provides access to extra functionality like web APIs (e.g., setTimeout, setInterval). It also manages event loops and handles callbacks and promises using queues like the callback queue and microtasks queue.
