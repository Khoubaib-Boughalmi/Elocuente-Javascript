/**
  . Optimizations During Runtime

    Several optimizations can happen during runtime:

    * JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation: In JavaScript, the engine (v8 for chrome) often uses JIT compilation to convert code into machine code just before execution, improving performance.
    
    * Inlining and Caching: The runtime may optimize repeated function calls by inlining small functions or caching results for reuse.

    * Lazy Loading: In some runtime environments, parts of the code or libraries may be loaded only when needed, improving startup time.
